<p>
    Jenkins serves many files that are potentially created by users that are not fully trusted, such as files in project workspaces or archived artifacts.
    Without this option set, Jenkins will only serve these files with the HTTP header <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> ("CSP") set to a value disallowing many modern web features to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on Jenkins users accessing these files.
    While the specific value for the CSP header is user configurable (and can even be disabled), doing so is a trade-off between security and functionality.
</p>
<p>
    If this option is set, Jenkins will redirect requests for user-created resource files to URLs starting with the URL configured here.
    For this option to work as expected, the following constraints and considerations apply:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Requests to this resource root URL must be routed to this Jenkins instance.</li>
    <li>The Jenkins root URL must be set and it must be different from this resource root URL (in fact, a different host name is required).</li>
    <li>Jenkins will only serve resource URL requests via the resource root URL, all other requests will get <em>HTTP 404 Not Found</em> responses.</li>
    <li>The resource root URL must be <em>equivalent</em> to the Jenkins root URL, i.e. if there were no restrictions on responses (above), the resource root URL would be a valid alternative Jenkins root URL.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Once this URL has been set up correctly, Jenkins will redirect requests to workspaces, archived artifacts, and similar collections of files to URLs starting with the resource root URL.
    Instead of a path like <code>job/name_here/ws</code>, resource URLs will contain a long hexadecimal string encoding that path, the user for which the URL was created, and when it was created.
    These resource URLs access static files <em>as if</em> the user for which they were created would access them:
    If the user's permission to access these files is removed, the corresponding resource URLs will not work anymore either.
</p>
<h3>Security considerations</h3>
<h4>Authentication</h4>
<p>
    Resource URLs do not require authentication (users will not have a valid session for the resource root URL).
    Sharing such a resource URL with another user, even one lacking Overall/Read permission for Jenkins, will grant that user access to these files until the URLs expire.
</p>
<h4>Expiration</h4>
<p>
    Resource URLs expire after 30 minutes by default.
    Expired resource URLs will redirect users to their equivalent Jenkins URLs, so that the user can reauthenticate, if necessary, and then be redirected back to a new resource URL that will be valid for another 30 minutes.
    This will generally be transparent to the user if they have a valid Jenkins session.
    If they do not have a valid session, they will need to authenticate with Jenkins again.
    When viewing e.g. pages with HTML frames, the login form will not be able to appear in a frame, and users will need to reload the top-level frame to make the login form appear.
</p>
<h4>Authenticity</h4>
<p>
    Resource URLs encode the URL, the user for which they were created, and their creation timestamp.
    Additionally, this string contains an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HMAC">HMAC</a> to verify the authenticity of the URL to prevent attackers from forging URLs granting them access to resource files as if they were another user.

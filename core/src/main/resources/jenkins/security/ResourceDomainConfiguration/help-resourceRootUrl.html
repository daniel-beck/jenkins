<p>
    Jenkins serves many files that are potentially created by users that are not fully trusted, such as files in project workspaces or archived artifacts.
    Without this option set, Jenkins will only serve these files with the HTTP header <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> ("CSP") set to a value disallowing many modern web features to prevent cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks on Jenkins users accessing these files.
    While the specific value for the CSP header is user configurable (and can even be disabled), doing so is a trade-off between security and functionality.

    If this option is set, Jenkins will redirect requests for user-created resource files to URLs starting with the URL configured here.
    For this option to work as expected, the following constraints must be satisfied:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>The Jenkins root URL must be set.</li>
    <li>Requests to this resource root URL must be routed to this Jenkins instance.</li>
    <li>This URL must be <em>equivalent</em> to the Jenkins root URL, e.g. both must use the same context path.</li>
    <li>Jenkins will only serve resource URL requests on this domain, all other requests will get <em>HTTP 404 Not Found</em> responses.</li>
</ul>

        This option improves the compatibility with plugins not specifically supporting this feature, at the cost of relaxed security checks.
    </p>
    <p>
        When <strong>unchecked</strong> (the default) plugins need to explicitly register every directory browser instance they intend to make available via a resource URL below the resources root URL.
        Otherwise it will not redirect requests to files to their corresponding resources URL, but serve files directly and add <code>Content-Security-Policy</code> headers.
        Registering includes defining security checks to perform on the user identity for which a resource URL is created before access is granted.
        As a result, when a user loses the permission to access a workspace, job, or other directory browser, the corresponding resource URLs will stop working as well, as the user's permissions are checked every time the resource URL is accessed.
    </p>
    <p>
        When <strong>checked</strong>, all directory browsers are implicitly registered on first access, and only require that the user retains read access to the model object (typically a job) that the directory browser is associated with.
        If a user loses a more specific, otherwise required permission, such as <code>Item/Workspace</code> or <code>Build/Artifacts</code>, they will still be able to access the files through resource URLs until those URLs expire.
